# ImageOrganizer
Organize your image folder based off faces. Utilizes OpenCV and a pretrained Keras CNN (facenet).

Takes a given image folder directory, and will create a folder of only the faces it finds from each and every image. Currently then requires some organiztion of a training set of that data with a name and from there will place every image containing the given face into a folder.
